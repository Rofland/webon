# Webon #

You may hear of some process monitoring tools which can tell you about CPU usage, memory consumption, file descriptor counts, etc. But that is too little. Is my application working correctly? What has been done? What is being processed? What is in the queue?

<b>Webon is a Java+JavaScript library bringing you the possibility and simplicity to monitor literally anything inside your application.</b> The Java part exposes application runtime states to an embedded Web server. The JavaScript part keeps querying those states and present them on your custom page.
